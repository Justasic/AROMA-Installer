* Programming Language
  It was application which runs on Android device but not on Android OS 
  Environment that the native applications usually use Java.
  AROMA Installer use C (Pure C, not C++), so it may run on another
  platform like x86 with small modifications ofcourse.

  ZLIB - ofcourse, it was the most awesome thing in computer world 
  PNG, MinZIP, Freetype.
  All library need to compiled as static to make sure it runs
  without any dependency issue in any devices.

* Official Binary
  I Only support ARM device, but it was opensourced, so anyone
  can play with the source and compiled it for they own devices.
